All PyTorch model weights were used when initializing TFRobertaForSequenceClassification.

All the weights of TFRobertaForSequenceClassification were initialized from the PyTorch model.
If your task is similar to the task the model of the checkpoint was trained on, you can already use TFRobertaForSequenceClassification for predictions without further training.
